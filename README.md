## Overall Learning 

This capstone project provided comprehensive hands-on experience in applying data analytics concepts to a real-world business problem. It strengthened my ability to work with raw, unstructured data and transform it into meaningful insights through systematic cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

I gained practical exposure to using Excel for data preparation, SQL for structured querying and aggregation, Python for exploratory analysis and basic predictive modeling, and Power BI for interactive dashboard creation. The project improved my understanding of how different tools integrate within an end-to-end analytics pipeline.

Additionally, the project enhanced my analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and data-driven decision-making ability. It also improved my capability to present insights clearly and professionally for business stakeholders, making the learning outcome both technically and practically valuable.

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1: Used Cars Data Analysis </h3>
<p>
  The Used Car Sales Analytics project focuses on analyzing used car data to identify pricing trends and determine factors influencing vehicle resale value. The primary objective was to clean raw data, analyze key variables affecting car prices, and build predictive models to support data-driven business decisions.

An end-to-end analytics workflow was implemented using Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI. Excel was used for data cleaning and preliminary analysis, SQL for structured querying and aggregations, Python for exploratory analysis and predictive modeling, and Power BI for creating interactive dashboards.

Key findings indicate that brand, mileage, vehicle age, and fuel type significantly impact resale prices. The predictive models demonstrated good accuracy in estimating prices and classifying high-value vehicles. Overall, the project showcases a complete real-world analytics pipeline from raw data to actionable business insights.

## **Learnings from LST and SST**

<!-- add your experiences over here -->

The Life Skills Training (LST) and Soft Skills Training (SST) sessions significantly contributed to my personal and professional growth during the internship. These sessions emphasized the importance of leadership qualities, self-discipline, time management, and maintaining a positive attitude in both academic and professional environments. I learned how discipline and consistency play a crucial role in achieving long-term goals.

The training sessions helped me strengthen my communication skills, including effective verbal communication, active listening, and appropriate body language. I gained a clear understanding of how to present ideas confidently and professionally through structured presentations and discussions. The SST sessions also focused on interview skills such as resume explanation, answering technical and HR questions, and handling interview situations with confidence.

Additionally, the sessions highlighted the importance of teamwork, adaptability, and professional ethics in the workplace. Overall, LST and SST sessions improved my confidence, professionalism, leadership mindset, and readiness to face real-world corporate and industry challenges.

## **Community Services**

<!-- add descreption in your own words -->

During my internship period, I actively participated in several community service activities that focused on social welfare, environmental sustainability, and support for underprivileged individuals. These initiatives helped me gain a deeper understanding of social responsibility and the role individuals play in contributing to community development.

Through active involvement in these activities, I learned the importance of empathy, compassion, and collective effort in addressing social challenges. Engaging directly with people in need made me more aware of real-life issues faced by underprivileged communities and motivated me to contribute beyond academic and technical responsibilities. These experiences strengthened my sense of civic duty, encouraged ethical behavior, and helped me develop a balanced perspective between professional growth and social contribution.
